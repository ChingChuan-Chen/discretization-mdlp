# Discretize Continuous-Valued Attributes with Minimum Description Length Principle 

This package is to implement the algorithm proposed in Usama Fayyad and Keki Irani (1993).

It discretizes the continuouss-valued attribute with recursive minimum entropy method.

# Implementation

```bash
bash build.sh
python main.py
```

Other details please refer to the code.
